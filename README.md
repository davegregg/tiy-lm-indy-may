# Setting up your Mac for Ruby development

* Open Terminal. It's inside Apps > Utilities (or search for it using
  Spotlight [the maginifying glass in the upper right]).
* Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)<sup><a href="#homebrew" id="homebrew-token">1</a></sup>.
	* It'll ask you to download something else - Command Line Tools. Let it.
* Install `rbenv`
  * `brew install rbenv`
  * `echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile`
* Install Ruby.
	* `rbenv install 2.3.3`
  * `rbenv global 2.3.3`
* Pop open a new Terminal tab (Command-t) and check your Ruby version.
	* `ruby -v`
	* Should read something similar to `ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21 revision 56859) [x86_64-darwin16]`. Don't worry about the number after the `p`. We're mainly concerned with making sure we're on Ruby 2.3.3.

## Let's set up git while we're at it

* `brew install git`
* Open a fresh Terminal tab and check the version.
	* `git --version`
	* Should read `git version 2.11.0` (or higher)
    * If it doesn't, try `brew upgrade git`
* Remember when you set up an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com) (it was in the prework). Well, we need to tell Git who you are there so things will match up later.
	* `git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"`
	* `git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"` (this should be the same email address you used to sign up for GitHub)
	* `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain` (rather than go into detail on what this does, [see GitHub's docs](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/).
    * If you're feeling more adventurous, go with the SSH key approach
      outlined here: <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/>
* Finally, we're going to ignore some Mac-specific files in our git
  commits. Run the follow commands:
  * `echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global`
  * `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`


# Your editor

With whichever text editor you chose (again, I recommended [Atom](https://atom.io/)), your life will be made considerably easier by installing the command line helpers.

If you're already pretty neckbeardy with a text editor, just stick with that; I'll assume you know what you're doing. And if you're into [Vim](http://www.vim.org) (or would like to be), we can chat offline.

Here's how to install the CLI helpers for Atom:

## Atom

Nothing to see here. `atom` is magically already there all along. If, for some reason, it isn't<sup><a href="#atom-check" id="atom-check-token">2</a></sup> pasting the following into Terminal should do the trick:

`ln -s /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom /usr/local/bin/atom`

Or, you should be able to open Atom, and find "Install Shell Scripts" in the Atom menu.

### Tweaking Atom

One of the things that makes Atom powerful is its package system. To
install a bunch of recommended packages that can make your life a bit
easier in the course, run this in Terminal:

`apm stars --user dummied --install`

Packages this will install:

- [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
- [atom-prettify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-prettify)
- [atom-wrap-in-tag](https://atom.io/packages/atom-wrap-in-tag)
- [autoclose-html](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html)
- [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker)
- [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
- [linter-ruby](https://atom.io/packages/linter-ruby)
- [linter-tidy](https://atom.io/packages/linter-tidy)
- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)

Review the linked documentation for those when you get a chance to
discover how they're used.

Also:

 - Click Atom > Snippets and paste in after the comments:
  ```
  '.source.js':
    'console.log':
      'prefix': 'log'
      'body': 'console.log(${1:\'test\'})$2'
  '.text.html.basic':
    'bootstrap template':
      'prefix': 'bootstrap',
      'body': """
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      """
    'html template':
      'prefix': 'html'
      'body': """
      <!DOCTYPE html>

      </body>
      </html>
      """
  ```

### One other editor set up thing

We're going to be working quite a bit with git, we're going to be writing a ton of commit messages along the way and it'll be handy to use our preferred text editor for creating those messages.

In Terminal:

#### Atom

`git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`

## Finally, let's tweak our Terminal prompt a bit

In class, it's going to be important that you know where you are in the filesystem before running commands. For instance: It's going to be a nightmare if you `git init` your home directory or `rm -f` (note: try not to do that) a directory you didn't intend.

So, we're going to make your prompt display the entire path to the current directory as so:

In Terminal (presumes Atom):

`atom ~/.bash_profile`

In Atom (or Sublime), paste the following at the top of that file:

```
PS1='\[`[ $? = 0 ] && X=2 || X=1; tput setaf $X`\]\h\[`tput sgr0`\]:$PWD\n\$ '
```

Save, close and open a new Terminal window or tab to see the result.

## Speaking of `rm -rf`

To avoid future headaches, let's get `rm -rf` out of our workflow.

`brew install trash`

trash is a package that moves things to your trash can rather than completely obliterating them.

## Your first Rubygem

So we can have a better formatted Ruby playground, let's go ahead and install [`pry`](http://pryrepl.org/)

`gem install pry`

# PostgreSQL

We won't be using databases until a bit later in class, but let's go ahead and get Postgres set up while we're at it:

`brew install postgresql`

`brew services start postgresql`

# Node

Similarly, we won't be delving into JavaScript until much later, but let's get that prepared while we're at it.

Go here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> and download the Mac installer. Click the installer and follow the instructions.


# Other Mac niceties

Since many of you are also new to the Mac, I wanted to throw in some other helpful Mac tips.

None of these are _required_, but they're nice-to-haves.

* **An app launcher:** Hunting around your Mac for a particular application to open gets tedious fast. You can use the built-in Spotlight (typically available via `âŒ˜-Space`). Or you can use a purpose-built app launcher like [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com). In general, I find specific app launchers like Alfred (generally available via `Command-Space`) a bit snappier and they tend to have additional features that you might find handy.
* **A password manager:** Maybe by the end of class, you'll want to write your own (but I wouldn't recommend it). In the meantime, you're going to have a ton of passwords floating around and the typical options - one password for them all, or trying to remember them all - are both _horrible_. Password managers such as [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) (recommended, but pricey - $35-$50 depending on the breaks), [Dashlane](http://lp.dashlane.com/cjv2/?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=US_Search_Brand_Exact&utm_medium=15594053097&utm_term=dashlane&gclid=CPWqiLWyl8YCFQYuaQodm0MA1g) or [LastPass](https://lastpass.com)<sup><a href="#lastpass" id="lastpass-token">3</a></sup> will make your life _significantly_ better and much more secure.
* **A better Terminal:** The default Terminal application on your Mac is _fine_, really. But if you want to take it a step further, I can highly recommend [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com). Bonus: It's _free_. Note: Download the test release (iTerm2 3.0.10 beta (OS 10.8+))
* **Dropbox:** We technically don't need this for class, but you'll need it sooner or later (and it's handy to sync data between your Mac and iPhone apps down the road).

## What _not_ to install

There is only a single application I'm going to ask you to _not install_ during class:

[GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com).

It's a fine app, but for class purposes, we want to learn Git from the bare metal. That way, said app makes more sense if you decide to use it later.
